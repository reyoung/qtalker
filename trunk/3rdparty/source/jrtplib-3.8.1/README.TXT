                                   JRTPLIB (v3.8.1)


                      Developed at the The Expertise Centre for 
                      Digital Media (EDM), a research institute  
                              of the Hasselt University

LIBRARY LOCATION AND CONTACT
============================

Normally, you should be able to download the latest version of the library
from this url:
	http://research.edm.uhasselt.be/jori/jrtplib/jrtplib.html

If you have questions about the library, you can mail me at:
	jori.liesenborgs@gmail.com
	
There is also a mailing list for the library. To subscribe to the list, 
just send an e-mail to jrtplib-subscribe@edm.uhasselt.be and you'll 
receive further instructions.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT
==============

I would like thank the people at the Expertise Centre for Digital Media
for giving me the opportunity to create this rewrite of the library.

INSTALLATION NOTES
==================

* To compile the library on a unix-like platform, just start the configure
  script. This should generate a makefile which you can use to start
  building the library using 'make'.

* To compile the library on an MS-Windows platfrom: Visual Studio
  workspace files are included. The project will search
  for JThread files in ..\jthread-1.2.1
  To compile the library without using JThread, comment the line
  with RTP_SUPPORT_THREAD in rtpconfig_win.h
  Note that for Visual Studio 6, you must have service pack 6 for 
  installed to be able to compile the library.

* The library documentation can be generated using Doxygen. An on-line
  version can be found at
  http://research.edm.uhasselt.be/jori/jrtplib/documentation/index.html

* For systems with low memory or for applications which will involve only
  a few participants at a time:
  You can set the HASHSIZE defines in rtpsources.h, rtpudpv4transmitter.h
  and rtpudpv6transmitter.h to a lower value to avoid memory being wasted.
  Note that the library will have to be recompiled.

* Used defines:
	- WIN32:
		For compilation on an Win32 platform.
	- _WIN32_WCE:
		Define needed for compilation on a WinCE platform
	- RTP_HAVE_SYS_FILIO:
		Set if <sys/filio.h> exists.
	- RTP_HAVE_SYS_SOCKIO:
		Set if <sys/sockio.h> exists.
	- RTP_BIG_ENDIAN:
		If set, assume big-endian byte ordering.
	- RTP_SOCKLENTYPE_UINT:
		Indicates that getsockname used an unsigned int as its
                third parameter.
	- RTP_HAVE_SOCKADDR_LEN:
		Indicates that struct sockaddr has an sa_len field.
	- RTP_SUPPORT_IPV4MULTICAST:
		Enables support for IPv4 multicasting.
	- RTP_SUPPORT_THREAD:
		Enables support for JThread.
	- RTP_SUPPORT_SDESPRIV:
		Enables support for RTCP SDES private items.
	- RTP_SUPPORT_PROBATION:
		If set, a few consecutive RTP packets are needed to validate
                a member.
	- RTP_SUPPORT_GETLOGINR:
		If set, the library will use getlogin_r instead of getlogin.
	- RTP_SUPPORT_IPV6:
		If set, IPv6 support is enabled.
	- RTP_SUPPORT_IPV6MULTICAST:
		If set, IPv6 multicasting support is enabled.
	- RTP_SUPPORT_SENDAPP:
		If set, sending of RTCP app packets is enabled.
	- RTP_SUPPORT_MEMORYMANAGEMENT:
		If set, the memory management system is enabled.
	- RTP_SUPPORT_RTCPUNKNOWN:
		If set, sending of unknown RTCP packets is enabled.
	- RTPDEBUG:
		Enables some memory tracking functions and some debug 
                routines.
